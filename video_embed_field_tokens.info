; Since someone might install our module through Composer, we want to be sure
; that the Drupal Composer facade knows we're specifying a contrib module.
; We do this by namespacing the dependency name with project name in format:
; dependencies[] = {project}:{module}
dependencies[] = token:token
dependencies[] = video_embed_field:video_embed_field
; Since the namespacing feature is new as of Drupal 7.40, we have to require at
; least that version of core.
